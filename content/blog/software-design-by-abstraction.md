In comparison, there is very little literature about Software Design of Functional Programs. Often people ask about the 'Patterns' of Functional Programming, but I believe the solutions is to stop pressing your Programs to adhere to patterns, but instead evolve your own patterns for your domain.",

Reason about the power of types: the 'algebra' in algebraic datatypes. Subtyping.

Reason about types via the amount of values they describe:
* We want to describe the exact amount of values that should be allowed (make illegal states impossible)
* What if you only had multiplication, variables and scalars???
  - Geometrical analogy: Try to come up with a volume of an L-shape of width x, cutoff at width c, height of (2*h), cutoff at h.
    It would be impossible to describe this only using multiplication! `2*x*h` captures a whole rectangle, not the L shape.
    Only sum types make this possible: `h * x + h * c = h * (x + c)`!

More refactoring through static types.

RESEARCH:
Maybe interview 'expert functional programmers'?

Maybe a simpler form of arguing the L-shaped thing is this by using the 'remotedata' thing from this post:
  https://5e89068c6daf890006031b1d--hungry-darwin-eccd5b.netlify.com/blog/quiz-test
(The `{ loaded : Bool, error : Bool }` thing).

Just show the connections: Types = Algebra = Squares (This is the hook!)

## Can we subtract types?

Not really, no. But we can abstract out a type variable that we set to 0: `Never`.

What is this post title? What does this have to do with abstraction exactly? Other ideas:
* Algebraic Design of State
* Algebraic Design of Data
* Maybe just split this post into two: The description describes quite something different than the content (???)
