## TODO

* Extend footer
  * Footer links sections
  * Build & add RSS feed
  * Twitter/GitHub/RSS icons
* Building this Blog Thumbnail?
* Write proper readme
* Publish repostory
* 'Release' a.k.a. advertise, a.k.a. tell people about this


## Structure

* `content/` contains markdown files that describe blog posts
* `images/` contains media that gets optimized by `elm-pages`, including images for the blog posts
* `src/` contains the source code of the html-generator for the webpage (what turns the markdown files to html)
* `gen/` contains generated source files from `elm-pages`
* `elm-markdown/` is my fork of `elm-markdown`, so I can depend on my experiments.
